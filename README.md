# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the roject
The objective of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
## Results

To complete this project, we use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the us geological website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

On the map the magnitude and location of each earthquake is shown in a popup marker.

The diameter of the markers for each earthquake reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing the context for the map data.

Seismic activity tectonic plates boundaries are added to the map to show the relationship between the location and frequency

## Summary
The web page is able to show all the earthquakes for the last week, and major earthquake and tectonic plates boundaries with three map option and a legend to show the map data. Also, the popup marker provides information about the magnitude and location of each earthquake.
